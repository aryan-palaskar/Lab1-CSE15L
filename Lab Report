## Command `cd`

Markdown code showing the command and its output
```
[user@sahara ~]$ pwd
/home
[user@sahara ~]$ cd
```
* The working directory was /home when the command was ran with no arguments.
* When the command was ran with no arguments it didn't return any error rather remained in the same directory. 






the working directory changed  to /lecture1 after running the command with a path to the directory argument and path as a file. 
when the command was ranned with a path to a directory it changed the current working directory to the path given in the argument. Although, when the command was given a file as an argument it returned an error saying the file is not a directory.
